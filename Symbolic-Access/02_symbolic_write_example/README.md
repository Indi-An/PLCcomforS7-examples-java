# 02 – Symbolic Write Example (Java) (works with all licenses)

This example demonstrates symbolic writes using full variable names.

It shows:
- Connect()
- creating a write request
- writing one or more values
- checking returned quality/message
- disconnecting

## Notes
- Make sure the target variables exist and are writable.
- Always check Quality/Message after a write.
