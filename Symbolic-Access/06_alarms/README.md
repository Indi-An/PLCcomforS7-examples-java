# 06 – Alarms (Java) (works with all licenses)

This example demonstrates alarm handling:
- reading alarm states
- detecting changes
- optionally acknowledging alarms (depends on PLC program/config)

## Notes
- Alarm behavior depends on your PLC project.
- For frequent updates, combine with subscriptions (03).
